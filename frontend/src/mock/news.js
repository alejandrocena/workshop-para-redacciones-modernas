    title:'Trump’s lawyers prepare to fight subpoena all the way to the Supreme Court',
    body:[
      'Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s lead lawyer for the ongoing Russia probe, said Wednesday that he is still awaiting a response from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to the Trump team’s latest terms for a presidential interview, which were made last week in a letter that argued against Trump’s having to answer questions about his possible obstruction of justice.',
      'In the meantime, Trump’s lawyers are preparing to oppose a potential subpoena from Mueller for a Trump sit-down by drafting a rebuttal that could set off a dramatic fight in federal courts.',
      '“We would move to quash the subpoena,” Giuliani said in an interview. “And we’re pretty much finished with our memorandum opposing a subpoena.”',
      'Giuliani added that Trump’s attorneys are ready to “argue it before the Supreme Court, if it ever got there.”',
      'In recent weeks, Giuliani said members of Trump’s team have “had conversations” with Emmet T. Flood, a White House lawyer working on issues related to the federal investigation. He said Flood “would have a big role to play here and would assert presidential privilege” but declined to say more about those discussions.',
      'White House officials have privately said Flood has cautioned Trump and others about the unpredictability of a subpoena fight that could be decided by the Supreme Court. Such a case would be unprecedented. Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr served President Bill Clinton with a subpoena to compel him to appear before a grand jury, but it was withdrawn after Clinton agreed to testify.',
      'Mueller, who is heading the federal probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and of Trump’s conduct, has sought a presidential interview for months. The president’s lawyers and Mueller have not reached an agreement.',

    title:'Aretha Franklin, music’s ‘Queen of Soul,’ dies at 76',
    body:[
      'Aretha Franklin, whose exceptionally expressive singing about joy and pain and faith and liberation earned the Detroit diva a permanent and undisputed title — the “Queen of Soul” — died Aug. 16 at her home in Detroit. She was 76.',
      'Her representative Gwendolyn Quinn announced the death and said the cause was pancreatic cancer.',
      'One of the most celebrated and influential singers in the history of American vernacular song, Ms. Franklin reserved her place on music’s Mount Rushmore in the late 1960s and early 1970s by exploring the secular sweet spot between sultry rhythm-and-blues and the explosive gospel music she’d grown up singing in her father’s Baptist church.',
      'The result was potent and wildly popular, with defining soul anthems that turned Ms. Franklin into a symbol of black pride and women’s liberation.',
      'Her calling card: “Respect,” the Otis Redding hit that became a crossover smash in 1967 after Ms. Franklin tweaked it just so (a “sock it to me” here, some sisterly vocal support there), transforming the tune into a fervent feminist anthem.',
      '“Whenever women heard the record, it was like a tidal wave of sororal unity,” the song’s producer, Jerry Wexler, said two decades after Ms. Franklin first declared, “R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me.”',
      'Twenty of her singles topped Billboard’s R&B chart and more than 50 reached the R&B Top 10 over a six-decade recording career during which she earned volumes of praise for her innovative and emotive vocal performances, even when the material didn’t quite measure up to her talents.',
      'A graceful mezzo-soprano stylist, Ms. Franklin had remarkable range, power and command, along with the innate ability to burrow into a lyric until she’d found the exact coordinates of its emotional core.',
      '“She just bared her soul, she exposed herself, she did everything but get on the floor and scream and cry,” singer Natalie Cole told VH1. “She just had that special something that people respond to.”',

    body:[
      'Voters in the House districts on the map above backed President Barack Obama in 2012 and President Trump in 2016.',
      'At the same time, eight of the 20 districts also elected a Democrat to the House — meaning many voters likely chose both a Democrat and a Republican on the same ballot.',
      'How will they react two years into Trump’s presidency, a notoriously bad year for whichever party holds the White House?',
      'After primary elections in Minnesota and Wisconsin on Tuesday, November matchups are set in all but one of these 20 Obama-Trump districts. (We’re also omitting one swing Pennsylvania district because the state has new district boundaries this time.) About half are considered intense battlegrounds for the fall, while others are held by popular incumbents who have garnered more support than the president in the past.',
      'Some districts swung wildly from Obama to Trump. Others barely crossed the line.',
      'Two Minnesota districts gave Trump the largest margins of this bunch. Democrats held both of those seats, but both are retiring, making them some of the most vulnerable in the country.',
      'In Minnesota’s 2nd District and Nevada’s 3rd District, Obama and Trump each posted very small margins of victory. Both House races are competitive this time around, with Democrats given a small advantage in the Nevada race.',
      'While Illinois’s 17th District narrowly backed Trump, it had previously supported Obama by double digits. It was a big swing toward Trump, but Rep. Cheri Bustos (D) won there by 20 points on the same ballot.'

      'People in South Korea and Taiwan unveiled monuments and staged protests on Tuesday to mark Japan’s wartime use of “comfort women”, a euphemism for girls and women forced to work in Japan’s wartime brothels.',
      'In South Korea, a new monument was unveiled as part of its first “Memorial Day for Japanese Forces’ Comfort Women Victims,” which threatens to exacerbate a sensitive diplomatic issue with Japan, South Korea’s neighbor and a key ally of the United States in efforts to contain North Korea.',
      '“My hope is that this issue will not lead to a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and Japan. I also do not think that this will be solved by a bilateral diplomatic solution,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in commemoration of the day.',
      'Moon said the issue involves “the entire world” and human rights of women as a whole, and pledged the South Korean government will respect the women as the main parties of the issue, and pursue commemorative projects to restore their honor and dignity including discovery, preservation and propagation of records.

      '74-year-old Paul Bradshaw, once called a liar for his claims, says he can now die happy.',
      'A 74-year-old man with terminal cancer said on Thursday he could die happy after reaching a 1 million Australian dollar ($727,000) landmark settlement against a Catholic religious order for sexual abuse he suffered in Australia more than 50 years ago.',
      'Paul Bradshaw was to testify on Thursday in the Western Australia state District Court about his ill treatment at Castledare Junior Orphanage and Clontarf Orphanage run by the Irish Chritian Brothers order in the 1950s and ’60s.',
      'But instead, a settlement was reached with the Trustees of the Christian Brothers for the abuse he suffered at the hands of Brothers Lawrence Murphy, Bruno Doyle and Christopher Angus, who are all dead.',
      'Bradshaw is the first victim to claim damages for historical child sex abuse under laws that recently came into effect in Western Australia, removing the time limit for such cases.',
      'He cried outside court, explaining his 60-year fight and said he was relieved his family would receive his compensation money. He said doctors had advised that he only had six months to live.',

      'Former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, longtime fans of Aretha Franklin, paid their respects to the Queen of Soul following her death.',
      '“Aretha helped define the American experience,” the Obamas said in a statement Thursday, after Franklin’s death at age 76 from pancreatic cancer. “In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade ― our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect. She helped us feel more connected to each other, more hopeful, more human. And sometimes she helped us just forget about everything else and dance.”',
      'The former president and first lady praised Franklin’s “compositions and unmatched musicianship.”',
      '“Every time she sang,” they added, “we were all graced with a glimpse of the divine.”',

      'Green energy supplier Ecotricity has launched the world’s first certified vegan electricity.',
      'Daniel Bedford is a heavily tattooed 48-year-old taxi driver. He’s also vegan. For the past six years, Bedford has prided himself on avoiding any animal-derived products, from leather shoes (although he still wears an old pair so they don’t go to waste) to mature cheddar, his favorite cheese. Last month, however, he discovered vegan electricity.',
      '“I had no idea the energy I was using at home could have come from animals,” said Bedford, who spends his days ferrying passengers around the busy streets of London. “My wife and I immediately switched energy suppliers when we found out.”',
      'While other energy providers may also provide vegan electricity, Ecotricity is the first company with a certification to prove it. According to Ecotricity’s Will Guyatt, the company sought the accreditation from U.K charity The Vegan Society “to highlight the fact that animal byproducts from factory-intensive farming are sneaking into the ingredients chain for energy.”',
      'Most of the electricity in countries like the U.S. and the U.K comes from burning fossil fuels. Renewables such as wind power, as well as nuclear energy, feature in the mix. But energy can also be derived from breaking down animal byproducts, like poultry poop, and even whole animals, into gas that can be burned.',

      'New York University will pay for the tuition of all its medical students, the first top-ranked institution in the country to do so, With the tuition scholarships, the school hopes to alleviate the rising costs of medical education, attract a more diverse class of top students and address physician shortages, NYU Medical School Dean Robert Grossman said on Thursday.',

      'Incoming medical students and those already enrolled will receive an annual scholarship of $55,018 to cover tuition starting this upcoming academic year, NYU said.',
      'More than 86 percent of medical school graduates carry educational debt, and 41 percent of those students reported their debt exceeded $150,000, according to the American Medical Student Association.',
      'Grossman said covering tuition for all students was at the forefront of his goals when he became dean about 12 years ago.',

    body:[
      'Obama carried Ohio in 2012, but Republicans have won the same 12 of the state’s 16 House seats in every election this decade.',
      'A lawsuit challenging Ohio’s congressional map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander can move forward, a federal court ruled Wednesday.',
      'The decision from a three-judge panel is a preliminary victory for the American Civil Liberties Union, five civic groups and 17 Ohio Democratic voters who filed the lawsuit. More significantly, the decision is the first from any lower court after the Supreme Court punted on two major cases involving partisan gerrymandering in June. Allowing the case to move forward is a small encouraging early sign for gerrymandering opponents, signaling that the Supreme Court’s June decisions haven’t closed off the courts to hearing gerrymandering claims.',
      'Republicans controlled Ohio’s redistricting process in 2011 and drew the state’s congressional map to their advantage. In each congressional election this decade, Republicans have won the same 12 of Ohio’s 16 U.S. House seats, even though President Barack Obama carried the state in 2012 and the GOP share of the statewide congressional vote has fluctuated between 51 and 59 percent. The Brennan Center for Justice estimates partisan gerrymandering in Ohio has yielded two to three additional seats for the GOP in Congress. The plaintiffs want to have the court strike down Ohio’s current congressional map and get a new one in place for the 2020 election.',
      'In June, the Supreme Court unanimously declined to step in and set a limit on when partisan gerrymandering goes so far that it violates the U.S. Constitution. It sent a challenge to Wisconsin’s Assembly map back to a lower court for further review, saying that voters could only bring a partisan gerrymandering challenge to the specific district they live in, not an entire map.',

      'For decades, stories about clerical sexual abuse committed by Pennsylvania Catholic priests were reportedly locked away in the church’s secret archives.',
      'These old secrets exploded into the light Tuesday with the publication of a grand jury report into six of Pennsylvania’s eight Roman Catholic dioceses.',
      'The jurors’ 884-page report allowed Pennsylvania Catholics to finally grasp the extent of the abuse ― and cover-up ― in six dioceses: Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton. Over the course of two years, jurors identified 301 “predator priests” and more than 1,000 victims.',
      'Jurors heard stories of boys and girls being groped. They heard about cases of kids becoming victims of child pornography, being made to masturbate with assailants, and being raped orally, vaginally and anally.'
