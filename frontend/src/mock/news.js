    dropline: 'As her husband continued to rip into his adversaries on Twitter, first lady Melania Trump on Monday warned that social media can be used in a “destructive and harmful” manner during remarks at a conference on preventing cyberbullying.',
    paragraphs: [
      '“In today’s global society, social media is an inevitable part of our children’s daily lives,” the first lady said. “It can be used in many positive ways but can also be destructive and harmful when used incorrectly.”',
      'Her message was part of a broader initiative, Be Best, that her office launched in May on improving children’s well-being, including “the safe and responsible use of social media,” as she characterized it in Monday’s remarks.',
      'Melania Trump made no mention of the president in her brief remarks at the outset of Monday’s conference in Rockville, Md. He had spent part of his morning taking fresh aim on Twitter at special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, calling him “disgraced and discredited.”',
      'After the first lady’s speech, President Trump was back on Twitter, calling John Brennan “the worst CIA Director in our country’s history.”',
      'The president’s use of Twitter to target his real and perceived enemies is well known. Only last week he prompted a new furor by referring to former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman as “that dog” — a term many found to be racist and misogynistic.'

    title:'Aretha Franklin, music’s ‘Queen of Soul,’ dies at 76',
    dropline: 'Aretha Franklin, whose exceptionally expressive singing about joy and pain and faith and liberation earned the Detroit diva a permanent and undisputed title — the “Queen of Soul” — died Aug. 16 at her home in Detroit. She was 76.',
    paragraphs:[
      'Her representative Gwendolyn Quinn announced the death and said the cause was pancreatic cancer.',
      'One of the most celebrated and influential singers in the history of American vernacular song, Ms. Franklin reserved her place on music’s Mount Rushmore in the late 1960s and early 1970s by exploring the secular sweet spot between sultry rhythm-and-blues and the explosive gospel music she’d grown up singing in her father’s Baptist church.',
      'The result was potent and wildly popular, with defining soul anthems that turned Ms. Franklin into a symbol of black pride and women’s liberation.',
      'Her calling card: “Respect,” the Otis Redding hit that became a crossover smash in 1967 after Ms. Franklin tweaked it just so (a “sock it to me” here, some sisterly vocal support there), transforming the tune into a fervent feminist anthem.',
      '“Whenever women heard the record, it was like a tidal wave of sororal unity,” the song’s producer, Jerry Wexler, said two decades after Ms. Franklin first declared, “R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me.”',
      'Twenty of her singles topped Billboard’s R&B chart and more than 50 reached the R&B Top 10 over a six-decade recording career during which she earned volumes of praise for her innovative and emotive vocal performances, even when the material didn’t quite measure up to her talents.',
      'A graceful mezzo-soprano stylist, Ms. Franklin had remarkable range, power and command, along with the innate ability to burrow into a lyric until she’d found the exact coordinates of its emotional core.',
      '“She just bared her soul, she exposed herself, she did everything but get on the floor and scream and cry,” singer Natalie Cole told VH1. “She just had that special something that people respond to.”',

    dropline: 'Voters in the House districts on the map above backed President Barack Obama in 2012 and President Trump in 2016.',
    paragraphs:[
      'At the same time, eight of the 20 districts also elected a Democrat to the House — meaning many voters likely chose both a Democrat and a Republican on the same ballot.',
      'How will they react two years into Trump’s presidency, a notoriously bad year for whichever party holds the White House?',
      'After primary elections in Minnesota and Wisconsin on Tuesday, November matchups are set in all but one of these 20 Obama-Trump districts. (We’re also omitting one swing Pennsylvania district because the state has new district boundaries this time.) About half are considered intense battlegrounds for the fall, while others are held by popular incumbents who have garnered more support than the president in the past.',
      'Some districts swung wildly from Obama to Trump. Others barely crossed the line.',
      'Two Minnesota districts gave Trump the largest margins of this bunch. Democrats held both of those seats, but both are retiring, making them some of the most vulnerable in the country.',
      'In Minnesota’s 2nd District and Nevada’s 3rd District, Obama and Trump each posted very small margins of victory. Both House races are competitive this time around, with Democrats given a small advantage in the Nevada race.',
      'While Illinois’s 17th District narrowly backed Trump, it had previously supported Obama by double digits. It was a big swing toward Trump, but Rep. Cheri Bustos (D) won there by 20 points on the same ballot.'

    title:'Sharknado, an inside joke that became a hit TV movie franchise, is officially dead',
    dropline: 'Sharknado, which ended for good with the sixth and final movie on Sunday night, wasn’t even supposed to exist. As the ridiculous origin story goes, the term was actually a throwaway line in another Syfy movie, “Leprechaun’s Revenge.”',
    paragraphs:[
      '“There’s this town in the movie that’s, I guess, being besieged by leprechauns . . . and somebody says: ‘Gosh, I hope we don’t go the way of that other town. They never recovered after the sharknado hit,’ ” writer Thunder Levin told Vice. “One of the execs at Syfy, that stuck with them and they thought, ‘Hey, we should make a movie called “Sharknado!” ’ ”',
      'Thus, Syfy’s hit Sharknado franchise was born. In July 2013, the entertainment industry was stunned when the low-budget TV movie about a deadly shark tornado in Los Angeles — starring Ian Ziering and Tara Reid — took over social media on a random Thursday night. Tweets about #Sharknado streamed in at a rate of 5,000 per minute. Celebrities joined in the gleeful chaos.',
      'The movie made little to no sense — and no one cared. It may have started as an inside joke, but it became a phenomenon. The network scheduled the film to re-air multiple times, and it racked up millions of viewers. Scientists weighed in on whether a sharknado could really happen. The stars were swamped with interview requests. Syfy quickly ordered a sequel. And then four more movies.',
      'The final installment of the “brilliantly stupid” franchise, titled “The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time,” went just as you might expect Sunday night. Ziering, who was initially so embarrassed about the first film that he refused to tell anyone about it, reprised his role as shark hunter Fin. Reid, who recently made headlines for a troubling viral interview to promote the movie, returned as his wife, April.'

    title:'The Dirty Secret In Your Electricity: Animals',

    paragraphs:[
      'Daniel Bedford is a heavily tattooed 48-year-old taxi driver. He’s also vegan. For the past six years, Bedford has prided himself on avoiding any animal-derived products, from leather shoes (although he still wears an old pair so they don’t go to waste) to mature cheddar, his favorite cheese. Last month, however, he discovered vegan electricity.',
      '“I had no idea the energy I was using at home could have come from animals,” said Bedford, who spends his days ferrying passengers around the busy streets of London. “My wife and I immediately switched energy suppliers when we found out.”',
      'While other energy providers may also provide vegan electricity, Ecotricity is the first company with a certification to prove it. According to Ecotricity’s Will Guyatt, the company sought the accreditation from U.K charity The Vegan Society “to highlight the fact that animal byproducts from factory-intensive farming are sneaking into the ingredients chain for energy.”',
      'Most of the electricity in countries like the U.S. and the U.K comes from burning fossil fuels. Renewables such as wind power, as well as nuclear energy, feature in the mix. But energy can also be derived from breaking down animal byproducts, like poultry poop, and even whole animals, into gas that can be burned.',

      'Grossman said covering tuition for all students was at the forefront of his goals when he became dean about 12 years ago.',

    dropline: 'Obama carried Ohio in 2012, but Republicans have won the same 12 of the state’s 16 House seats in every election this decade.',
    paragraphs:[
      'A lawsuit challenging Ohio’s congressional map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander can move forward, a federal court ruled Wednesday.',
      'The decision from a three-judge panel is a preliminary victory for the American Civil Liberties Union, five civic groups and 17 Ohio Democratic voters who filed the lawsuit. More significantly, the decision is the first from any lower court after the Supreme Court punted on two major cases involving partisan gerrymandering in June. Allowing the case to move forward is a small encouraging early sign for gerrymandering opponents, signaling that the Supreme Court’s June decisions haven’t closed off the courts to hearing gerrymandering claims.',
      'Republicans controlled Ohio’s redistricting process in 2011 and drew the state’s congressional map to their advantage. In each congressional election this decade, Republicans have won the same 12 of Ohio’s 16 U.S. House seats, even though President Barack Obama carried the state in 2012 and the GOP share of the statewide congressional vote has fluctuated between 51 and 59 percent. The Brennan Center for Justice estimates partisan gerrymandering in Ohio has yielded two to three additional seats for the GOP in Congress. The plaintiffs want to have the court strike down Ohio’s current congressional map and get a new one in place for the 2020 election.',
      'In June, the Supreme Court unanimously declined to step in and set a limit on when partisan gerrymandering goes so far that it violates the U.S. Constitution. It sent a challenge to Wisconsin’s Assembly map back to a lower court for further review, saying that voters could only bring a partisan gerrymandering challenge to the specific district they live in, not an entire map.',
